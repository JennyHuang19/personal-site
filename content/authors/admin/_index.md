I am a first year PhD student studying machine learning at MIT, fortunate to be working in the department of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) in [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/) with Professor [Tamara Broderick](https://tamarabroderick.com/)!

Before coming to MIT, I did my undergrad at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/), where I worked with many amazing people, including [Jason Xu](https://jasonxu90.github.io/), [David Dunson](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dunson), [Cynthia Rudin](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/cynthia-rudin), and [Rick Durrett](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/). Before Duke, I went to the [NC School of Science and Math](https://www.ncssm.edu/), where I developed a love for all things STEM!

In my free time, I enjoy poetry (particularly, nature-themed) and dance (hip-hop, swing, ballet)!
