I am a third year PhD student studying machine learning at MIT, working in the department of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) with Professor [Tamara Broderick](https://tamarabroderick.com/). My work is supported by the Amazon AI Research Innovation Fellowship and has been supported by the MIT Presidential and Quad Fellowships.

In my free time, I enjoy writing in coffee shops and rummaging through Cambridge bookstores as well as playing volleyball and signing up for dance classes on a whim!
