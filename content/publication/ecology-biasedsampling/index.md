abstract: Primates harbor diverse parasite communities that vary widely across species. Investigating this cross-species variation requires comparative approaches, yet inferences from comparative research on parasitism are limited by variation in sampling effort: some hosts, and some parasites, are better studied than others. Previous studies have attempted to address these limitations using richness estimators or by including a measure of sampling effort in the statistical models, with limited success. We take a novel approach to address sampling bias by imputing shared parasites using both host phylogeny and geography in a link prediction model. We then conduct a Bayesian phylogenetic regression to analyze how host traits influence the estimated richness of parasites with different transmission modes. Edge imputation reduced the effect of sampling bias but did not eliminate it completely.
