abstract: Primates harbor diverse parasite communities that vary widely across species. Investigating this cross-species variation requires comparative approaches, yet inferences from comparative research on parasitism are limited by variation in sampling effort: some hosts, and some parasites, are better studied than others. Previous studies have attempted to address these limitations using richness estimators or by including a measure of sampling effort in the statistical models, with limited success. We take a novel approach to address sampling bias by imputing shared parasites using both host phylogeny and geography in a link prediction model. We then conduct a Bayesian phylogenetic regression to analyze how host traits influence the estimated richness of parasites with different transmission modes. Edge imputation reduced the effect of sampling bias but did not eliminate it completely. Body mass predicted higher richness of parasites transmitted via close-contact and the environment, while arboreality was associated with lower richness of parasites transmitted via close-contact and intermediate hosts. Even after edge imputation, sampling bias continued to influence variation in parasite species richness in primates, with effects of sampling effort remaining statistically important in the models. We conclude that advancements in the prediction of missing host-parasite links can strengthen inferences made with existing data, but they do so incompletely. Our findings therefore call for more systematic study of parasites in wild animals to advance comparative research on parasitism.
