abstract: The goal of low-income fare subsidy programs is to increase equitable access to public transit, and in doing so, increase access to jobs, housing, education and other essential resources. King County Metro, one of the largest transit providers focused on equitable public transit, has been innovative in launching new programs for low-income riders. However, due to the observational nature of data on ridership behavior in King County, evaluating the effectiveness of such innovative policies is difficult.
